    Introduction

<p>Many of the features in Office are geared toward saving and sharing files online. OneDrive is Microsoft’s online storage space that you can use to save, edit, and share your documents and other files. You can access OneDrive from your computer, smartphone, or any of the devices you use.

    To get started with OneDrive, all you need to do is set up a free Microsoft account, if you don’t already have one.</p>
